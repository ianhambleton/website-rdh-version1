**Draft** Research Data Handling policy for The Univesity of the West Indies, Cave Hill campus.

{{% callout note %}}
This is an _aspirational_ policy, and we expect full implementation to take several years. An accompanying RDH roadmap monitors progress towards achieving policy goals. [Explore the roadmap]({{< ref "#roadmap" >}}) to see our progress.

|section|policy|
|---|---|
|A.|Research data will be managed to the highest standards throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the University’s commitment to research excellence. <p style="color:blue"><sup>Note A</sup></p>|
|B.	|Responsibility for research data management through a sound research data management plan during any research project or programme lies primarily with Principal Investigators (PIs).<p style="color:blue"><sup>Note B</sup></p>|
|C.	|All new research proposals [from date of RDM Policy adoption] must include research data management plans or protocols that explicitly address data capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, sharing and publication.<p style="color:blue"><sup></sup></p>|
|D.	|The University will provide training, support, advice and where appropriate guidelines and templates for research data management and the associated research data management plan.<p style="color:blue"><sup></sup></p>|
|E.	|The University will provide mechanisms and services for storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.<p style="color:blue"><sup>Note E</sup></p>|
|F.	|Any data which is retained elsewhere, for example in an international data service or domain repository should be registered with the University.<p style="color:blue"><sup>Note F</sup></p>|
|G.	|Research data management plans must ensure that research data are available for access and re-use where appropriate and under appropriate safeguards.<p style="color:blue"><sup>Note G</sup></p>|
|H.	|The legitimate interests of the subjects of research data must be protected.<p style="color:blue"><sup>Note H</sup></p>|
|I.	|Research data of future historical interest, and all research data that represent records of the University, including data that substantiate research findings, will be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in an appropriate national or international data service or domain repository, or a University repository.<p style="color:blue"><sup></sup></p>|
|J.	|Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use, unless this is a condition of funding.<p style="color:blue"><sup>Note J</sup></p>|
|K.	|The University will work towards meeting the FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and discovery.<p style="color:blue"><sup>Note K</sup></p>|

Explanatory Notes:

|section|explanatory note|
|---|---|
|<p style="font-size:12px">Note A| The University will (in accompanying guidelines and training materials) make the concept of the Research Data Lifecycle clear to all parties.</p>|
|<p style="font-size:12px">Note B| Think about multi-centre grants involving a non-UWI Principal Investigator. Studies would therefore need to include local (UWI) leads to enact these responsibilities.</p>|
|<p style="font-size:12px">Note E| Particularly aspirational. Will take time to ‘get right’. Core funding inevitably required. Consider concept of RDH Unit as a fee-paying consultancy service – using the income from data consultancy to fund the RDH services…?</p>|
|<p style="font-size:12px">Note F| How to enact such a process? Linked to UWI administrative requirements for staff.</p>|
|<p style="font-size:12px">Note G| Speaks to need for substantial training on how to prepare / curate a data resource for publication.</p>|
|<p style="font-size:12px">Note H| Link to University IRB infrastructure.</p>|
|<p style="font-size:12px">Note J| For discussion. GA-CDRC (for example) have occasionally received requests for purchase of research data.</p>|
|<p style="font-size:12px">Note K| FAIR data are data that meet principles of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. A March 2016 publication by a consortium of scientists and organizations specified the "FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship" in Scientific Data, using FAIR as an acronym and making the concept easier to discuss. Universities can sign up to implementing an infrastructure that encourages FAIR data. More details at: https://www.go-fair.org/</p>|
